## Rules (thanks to Wikipedia)
A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions:

They all have the same number or have three different numbers.
They all have the same symbol or have three different symbols.
They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.
They all have the same color or have three different colors.
The rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into "two of \_\_\_\_ and one of \_\_\_\_", then it is not a set.

For example, these three cards form a set:

One red striped diamond
Two red solid diamonds
Three red open diamonds
Given any two cards from the deck, there is one and only one other card that forms a set with them.
