Login.java is the main file

LoginPage.java and LandingPage.java are self explanatory

28th January, 8:23AM:

Login Window with username and password fields
Landing page with username shown and logout button

Need to add the following:

Toggle switch for login / signup
Add confirm password field for signup and check that passwords match
Prepare for server side errors (user already exists, etc.)
